                  aggregate web statistics, such as collecting the number of Users to the Website, the number of repeat Users and the most
                  popular webpages, to serve relevant content to a User as he/she browses the Internet, and for other purposes. You may
                  choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, however, some

                <p class="text-muted"
                  >DDemos, on its own and through select third party vendors, collects personally identifiable information, such as names,
                  email addresses, mailing addresses and credit card information, from Users when they voluntarily provide such information
                  to us, including, for example, when a User signs up to join our email list, purchases tickets to an event, completes the
                  contact form, responds to a job posting, or donates money via the Website. Complete credit card information, however, is
                  not stored.</p

                <h3>How Demos Uses the Information that it Collects</h3>
                <p class="text-muted"
                  >Demos uses Users’ personal information to better understand how Users use the Website so that we can improve the Website
                  and its offerings. Demos also uses Users’ personal information for the purpose for which the Users provided the
                  information, in other words, for example, to add you to our email list, to process your request for tickets to an event,
                  to respond to your inquiry, to consider you for a job, or to process your donation. If you affirmatively opt-in to our
                  email list, we will add you to our list. If at any time you wish to stop receiving emails from us, please follow the
                  unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any email Demos sends you.</p

                <p class="text-muted"
                  >Demos adopts appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to help protect against
                  unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, but Demos cannot guarantee that
                  your information is 100% secure. Your credit card information is not stored by Demos.</p

                <h3>Sharing Personal Information</h3>
                <p class="text-muted"
                  >We use third party service providers, including, for example, Mailchimp, Rallybound, EventBrite and HiringThing, to help
                  us operate the Website and administer activities on our behalf, such as collecting donations online and registering Users
                  for events. These third party vendors may have access to User information, which becomes subject to their individual
                  privacy policies. In addition, Demos shares personal information about Users with Demos Action, our sister organization.
                  Demos may also share personal information with other like-minded organizations. In addition, Demos will share personally
                  identifiable information about Users when required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is
                  necessary to comply with state and federal laws or to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. Demos will
                  also share personally identifiable information if it believes it is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety
                  of Demos or others.</p
